# PowerBI_HR_Attendance Analysis

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and visualize HR-related data to gain insights into workforce dynamics, employee performance, and other critical HR metrics. The PowerBI dashboard serves as a powerful tool for presenting these insights in a visually appealing and accessible manner.

Leveraging PowerBI's robust capabilities, the dashboard was designed to showcase key metrics such as overall attendance rates, employee punctuality, and absenteeism trends over specific time periods. The integration of HR data allowed for the identification of patterns and correlations, aiding in the assessment of workforce attendance efficiency.
